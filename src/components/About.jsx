					My journey began in the world of software development, initially fueled by a passion for game development. As I went deeper, I found myself learning web/software development as a hobby and gaining some freelance experience. It wasn't long before I discovered the dynamic field of
					digital marketing. I realized that even the most brilliant website or SaaS product can't reach its full potential without effective marketing. This led me down the path of SEO and PPC.
